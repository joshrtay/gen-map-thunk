[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/feross/standard)

Map generator items on to a thunk. Great for async action creators in redux and more generally, for moving io to the edges of an application.

## Installation

    $ npm install gen-map-thunk

## Usage

```js
import map from 'gen-map-thunk'
import fetch from 'whatwg-fetch'

let state = {}

map(function (action) {
  if (action.type === 'FETCH') {
    return fetch(action.payload.url).then(function (res) {return res.json})
  } else if (action.type === 'SET') {
    state[action.payload.key] = action.payload.value
  }
}, function * () {
  try {
    let posts = yield {type: 'FETCH', payload: {url: '/posts'}}
    yield {type: 'SET', payload: {key: 'posts', value: posts}}
  } catch (e) {
    yield {type: 'SET', payload: {key: 'posts_error': value: 'FAILED_GET'}}
  }

})

```
